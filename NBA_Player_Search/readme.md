# NBA Player Search

# Description

This is a Django project which utilizes the nba_api module to retrieve player stats. 
It will display your search history and users will also be able to create/edit/delete players.

#Motivation

I wanted to experiment with Python and found Django to be a good starting point for a project. 
After following some setup tutorials I decided to focus on CRUD operations and used NBA as the topic.
From there I started brainstorming ideas on which new modules and techniques to add to my project in order to expand my knowledge.

#Technologies learned

# Feedback
Please provide any feedback on how to improve my techniques.
Additionally, I am open to any new features to add on as this is somewhat of a sandbox approach.
